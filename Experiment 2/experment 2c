# Experiment 2C: Demonstration of Network Topologies

## 🎯 Objective
To implement various network topologies using Packet Tracer, including Ring, Bus, Mesh, Star, and Hybrid topologies.

---

## 🧰 Common Components Required

- Multiple PCs
- Multiple Switches
- Copper Straight-through Cables

---

## 🧪 Topology Implementations

### 🔁 Ring Topology

- Connect PCs and switches in a circular manner.
- Assign IP addresses sequentially.
- Test connectivity by pinging neighbors.

### 🔀 Mesh Topology

- Each PC is connected to every other PC.
- Useful for fault tolerance.
- Assign static IPs and test connections.



---

### ⭐ Star Topology

- All PCs connect to a central switch.
- Simple to manage and scalable.



---

### 🔄 Hybrid Topology

- Combination of multiple topologies above.
- Flexibly built depending on requirement.
